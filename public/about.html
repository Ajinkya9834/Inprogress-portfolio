<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  I'm AJINKYA HAJARE. I graduated in mechanical engineering from Shivaji University in 2022 with an aggregate of 84%.
  `During my college years, I was a committee member of my department and involved in organizing events, having meetings with the HOD, and interacting with the president of the department and other members.
   This taught me the importance of punctuality and responsibility. I even represented my college in chess at the zonal level.</p>
   
   
   
   
  

 <p> In my free time, I read books. While it's not a formal hobby, 
  I wanted to gain as much knowledge as I could so it could help me make decisions in my professional as well as my personal life.
   Additionally, I like Elon Musk's work ethics, which I follow.
   .</p>

<p>    Talking about my technical skills, I know Java ,C++, DotNet . 
  I even made a mini-project in C++ in which I implemented CRUD operations, and in the upcoming module, I will learn Dot Net.
